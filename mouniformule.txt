---------------------------------------------------


1 kg of Hydrogen = 1/Hydrogen Density


Electrolyser Efficiency
=Lower Heating Value of Hydrogen
/Specific Power Consumption 

---------------------------------per hour--------------
Hydrogen Production Rate
=(Electrolyser Capacity *(if units= "MW",1000,1)*1 kg of Hydrogen ) /Specific Power Consumption = units Nm3/hr

Hydrogen Production Rate*Hydrogen Density = units kg/hr
 

Oxygen Production Rate = Hydrogen Production Rate/2 = units Nm3/hr

Oxygen Production Rate*Oxygen Density
= units kg/hr

Water Consumed by Stack=Hydrogen Production Rate = units kg/hr
----------------------------------------per day----------

Hydrogen Production Rate(d) = Hydrogen Production Rate*Electrolyser Operating Time 

Hydrogen Production Rate(d)*Hydrogen Density = units kg/day 

Oxygen Production Rate(d) = Oxygen Production Rate*Electrolyser Operating Time = units Nm3/hr

Oxygen Production Rate(d)*Oxygen Density
= units kg/day

Water Consumed by Stack=Hydrogen Production Rate(d) = units kg/day

for this description i want an effective website dynamic and responsive. colourful. for Nm3/hr and kg/hr result put one toggle button like and and hours result in one card and days result in one card. 

build very proficient website using html,css and javascript.
